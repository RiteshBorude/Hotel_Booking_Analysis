In this I have cover the full process of Data Analysis,visualization and cleaning the data which provides us the useful insights from which we can give suggestions or recomendations to the hotels by how they can lower their rate of cancelation and various other factors that are affecting the growth of respective hotels and giving them usefule insights with the help of Pythons Data Visualization Libraries. So the following steps were carried out to do the Exploratory Data Analaysis- 1.Studying the problem statement. 2.Identify the data we want to analyse. 3.Exploring and Cleaning the data. 4.Analyse the data to create the useful plots and graphs to get useful insights."

What if you wanted to predict whether or not a hotel was likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests? This hotel booking dataset can help you explore those questions! This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. All personally identifying information has been removed from the data. Explore and analyze the data to discover important factors that govern the bookings."
